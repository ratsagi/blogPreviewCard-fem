## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Box-model
- Local fonts


### What I learned

In this chellenge I learned how to add local fonts to project by @font-face:
 ```css
@font-face {
    font-family: figtreeRegular;
    src: url('fonts/Figtree-VariableFont_wght.ttf');
    font-weight: 400;
}
 ```

This project also remind me the importance of the size of image must  always  be specified in percentage for responsiveness like this:
```css
img{
    max-width: 100%;
}
```
